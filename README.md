# stevegardiner26.github.io

## Todos

- Fundamentally update the site to be up to date.
- Use VueJs or Alpine because I wrote this terribly when I first wrote it.
- Show logo on mobile
- Simplify the site with less pages. Not all this info needs to be on there.
- Add all projects from school, work and mafia city and fun.
- Remove all skill levels. Less is more.
